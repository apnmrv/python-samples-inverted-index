Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.
There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.
Anarchism is often considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy
reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.
Anarchism as a mass social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity.
The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism,
with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon  which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents
and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations.
Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression, supporting self-defense or non-violence
